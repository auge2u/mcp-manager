## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Claude to access private data, APIs, and other services to answer questions and perform actions on your behalf. Learn more about MCP at:

## Development

### Installation Options

There are two ways to set up the development environment:

1. **Using LaunchMCPs Script (Recommended)**
   
   This method automatically sets up the MCP Manager along with the task-manager and vision-conflict MCPs from [CLINE-MCP-Tasks](https://github.com/auge2u/CLINE-MCP-Tasks):

   ```bash
   # Coming soon: LaunchMCPs script that will:
   # 1. Clone both repositories (mcp-manager and CLINE-MCP-Tasks)
   # 2. Install dependencies safely
   # 3. Configure the task-manager and vision-conflict MCPs
   # 4. Start all services
   ```

2. **Manual Installation**

   If you prefer to install manually or encounter security warnings:

   ```bash
   # Note: Bun may flag some postinstall scripts as untrusted
   # This is a security feature protecting against potentially harmful scripts
   # You have several options:
   
   # Option 1: Use npm/yarn instead of bun
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install

   # Option 2: Use bun but skip postinstall scripts
   bun install --no-post-install
   # Then manually install biome:
   npm install -g @biomejs/biome

   # Option 3: Use bun and explicitly trust the scripts
   bun install
   # Review and approve any security prompts
   ```

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
bun dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

### Understanding Bun Security

Bun's runtime includes security features that may flag certain postinstall scripts as untrusted, particularly those that:
- Execute shell commands (using child_process)
- Download/install binaries
- Perform filesystem operations

This is a security measure to protect against potentially malicious packages. While packages like @biomejs/biome are safe and come from trusted sources, Bun takes a cautious approach to automatically executing such scripts.

## Included MCP Servers

### Task Management MCP
The task-manager MCP provides tools for:
- Creating and managing development tasks
- Tracking task priorities and dependencies
- Organizing tasks by category
- Monitoring task completion status

### Vision Conflict MCP
The vision-conflict MCP helps maintain project alignment by:
- Managing project vision statements
- Checking task alignment with project goals
- Identifying and resolving conflicts
- Tracking vision-related metrics

Both MCPs are included in the [CLINE-MCP-Tasks](https://github.com/auge2u/CLINE-MCP-Tasks) repository and are automatically configured when using the LaunchMCPs script.

## Contributing

Contributions are extremely welcome! Please open a PR with new MCP servers or any other improvements to the codebase.
PS. I wasnt able to get fetch, time, and sentry working, if you can help me out, that would be great!
